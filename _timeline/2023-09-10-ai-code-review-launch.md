## <span class="ide-keyword">Technical</span> <span class="ide-class">Implementation</span>

The tool combines machine learning with traditional static analysis to provide comprehensive code review capabilities. The ML model was trained using a diverse dataset of open-source repositories and known bug patterns.

### <span class="ide-class">Model</span> <span class="ide-class">Architecture</span>

- **Base Model**: Microsoft CodeBERT for code understanding
- **Classification Layer**: Custom neural network for bug severity prediction
- **Training Data**: 10M+ code samples from GitHub repositories
- **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation with 87% accuracy

### <span class="ide-class">Integration</span> <span class="ide-class">Features</span>

- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit and pre-push analysis
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions and GitLab CI integration
- **API**: RESTful API for custom integrations
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time analysis results and metrics

## <span class="ide-keyword">Next</span> <span class="ide-class">Steps</span>

Based on beta feedback, the roadmap for v1.0 includes:

- **Enhanced Language Support**: Adding support for Go, Rust, and TypeScript
- **Custom Rules Engine**: Allow teams to define custom coding standards
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduce analysis time by 50%
- **Advanced Metrics**: Code complexity and maintainability scores
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared review templates and standards

<span class="ide-comment">// This project showcases the potential of AI in software development</span>

The launch of this tool represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer and demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in software engineering workflows.
